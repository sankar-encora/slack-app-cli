<b>Installation</b>
1. Download the code from repo or clone repo from GIT
2. Run `npm install` to install packages
3. Need to add SLACK TOKEN & CHANNEL NAME to send message to channel. So token was created with slack website based on steps and permission was given access the <i>chat</i> endpoints. Shared this token privately.
4. Added bin commands to excute this CLI globally to use this command to make it `npm link`
5. To execute for checking need to use command `slackcli sendMessage' for sending chat message into slack channel.
